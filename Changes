 * Added a check in the Parser to make sure that all lines that share
   a single ID have the same type.

1.8       2013-10-28 10:57:26 EST5EDT

 * Fixed a bug in which feature lines with no ID, Parent, or
   Derives_from attributes were being returned as a bare hashref
   instead of a single-element arrayref as they should be.

1.7       2013-10-02 15:49:40 EST5EDT

 * Added `max_lookback` method to Parser, allowing applications to set
   a maximum number of features to be stored in case they might be
   referenced by features coming later in the file.  Can make it
   possible to parse GFF3 that does not contain enough '###'
   directives.

1.6       2013-07-26 11:24:16 EST5EDT

 * Improved the error message for when references between features
   cannot be resolved.  Instead of just Data::Dumper-ing the data
   structure, prints a formatted report of which references could not
   be resolved.

1.5       2012-12-14 12:40:58 America/New_York

 * Added minimum Test::More version of 0.88 to tests.

1.4       2012-08-28 15:09:51 America/New_York

 * Fix 1.0-backcompat crashing bug for GFF3 files with multi-location features.

1.3       2012-04-25 09:52:00 America/New_York

 * Correct synopsis section of Bio::GFF3::LowLevel::Parser.

1.2       2012-04-13 17:47:29 America/New_York

 * Removed unnecessary dependency on
   Bio::GFF3::Transform::SyncDirectives that was causing installation
   problems.

1.1       2012-04-13 01:32:21 America/New_York

 * Changed the default API of Bio::GFF3::LowLevel::Parser to support
   multi-loc features.  In order to be able to group feature lines
   that hand in some cases it would not be possibleave the same ID
   attribute, it now returns arrayrefs that are groups of the
   formerly-returned hashrefs.

 * HOWEVER, there is a backward-compatibility layer that back-converts
   the features to the conform to the return types in 1.1.  Existing
   users of this code should not be adversely affected.

 * Add better support for Derives_from: feature line hashrefs now have
   a derived_features attribute holding an arrayref of the features
   that Derives_from this one.

 * Remove assumptions in the parser about child features coming after
   their parents in the file.  The GFF3 specification does not require
   this.

1.0       2012-03-21 00:51:41 America/Los_Angeles

 * made parsing twice as fast as version 0.9, thanks to Devel::NYTProf
 * fix bad bug with dropping the last few features in files with sync
   directives

0.9       2012-03-20 20:26:04 America/Los_Angeles

 * write the missing documentation
 * make all features have child_features, for convenience
 * strip whitespace from the end of comments before returning them

0.8       2012-03-20 17:24:50 America/Los_Angeles

 * bugfix to handling of windows line-endings: parsers now remove them
   regardless of the platform on which we are running.
 * add gff3_parse_directive function to Bio::GFF3::LowLevel

0.7       2011-10-05 14:01:47 America/Los_Angeles

 * when formatting GFF3 attributes, force ID, Name, Alias, and Parent
   to be printed first.

0.6       2011-09-21 15:22:06 America/Los_Angeles

 * when formatting GFF3 attributes, don't print attributes with no
   value

0.5       2011-06-08 13:04:39 America/Los_Angeles

 * tweak syncdirectives transform to hopefully work on win32

0.4       2011-04-26 14:45:29 America/Los_Angeles

 * fix tests for older perls

0.3       2011-04-21 16:39:27 America/Los_Angeles

 * fixed bug in SyncDirectives (gff3_insert_sync_directives)
   transform, did not work if the file contained trailing tabs.
 * added Bio::GFF3::Transform::FromFasta, which can make gff3 from
   fasta

0.2       2011-03-08 15:43:01 America/New_York

 * squash some warnings in LowLevel.pm
 * add -i (in-place) option to gff3_insert_sync_directives
   command-line script

0.01   2011-02-23 23:45 America/Los_Angeles

 * initial release
